run parameter: dataset topk codebook Ks group top_norm batch_vecs batch_query threads_per_block

file parameter:
num_vecs num_dimen num_query
quantization str e.g. NPPPNPPP

each quantization nq or pq 
print Ks codeword first nq one line, pq one vector one line
then codebook both one line.

next for the query
query vector 
threshold 
candidate answer

one floating number for the total time of this threshold

last for the vecs
each line for one vec: num_dimen
